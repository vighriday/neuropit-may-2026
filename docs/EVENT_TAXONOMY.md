# Event Taxonomy

This is the working list of every Kafka topic NeuroPit uses, what flows through it, and who reads it. It maps directly to Section 39 of the PRD and to the topic names that already appear inside `src/backend/init_infrastructure.py`.

If you add a new topic anywhere in the code, add it here first. If a payload changes shape, bump the version on the schema example. The dashboard, the API gateway, and the cognitive engine all assume the names below.

## Conventions

Every topic uses the driver_id as the partition key when one is available. Global events fall back to the literal string `global`. Payloads are UTF 8 JSON. Timestamps are always ISO 8601 in UTC. We keep the schema flat where we can so that downstream consumers do not need to walk deeply nested objects in the hot path.

We deliberately keep the topic count small in V1. Each topic carries one well defined intent.

## Live topics in V1

### cognitive-prescriptions
Carries one prescription envelope per cognitive evaluation. Produced by the prescription worker after joining the cognitive state with the latest predictive failure forecast for the same driver. The Mission Control surface subscribes through the gateway. Every prescription is also appended to the audit log so the call is reproducible.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "kind": "prescription",
  "driver_id": "VER",
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.100Z",
  "prescription": {
    "driver_id": "VER",
    "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.100Z",
    "optimality": {
      "cognitive_efficiency": 32.6,
      "performance_lost_s": 1.01,
      "weighted_distance": 2.24,
      "centroid": {"stress_score": 62.0, "confidence_score": 78.0, "fatigue_score": 44.0, "cognitive_load_score": 66.0, "panic_probability": 18.0},
      "deltas": {"stress_score": 16.0, "confidence_score": -37.0, "fatigue_score": 19.0, "cognitive_load_score": 5.0, "panic_probability": 6.0},
      "contributions": {"confidence_score": 0.87, "fatigue_score": 0.07, "stress_score": 0.05, "panic_probability": 0.01, "cognitive_load_score": 0.004},
      "sample_count": 0,
      "persona_seed": "Aggressive"
    },
    "primary": {
      "code": "box_now",
      "label": "Pit window: immediate",
      "surface": "strategy",
      "summary": "Panic probability and tunnel vision risk a session ending incident. Pit now.",
      "score": 62.0,
      "triggers": ["forecast_panic_above_55"],
      "blocked_by": [],
      "projected_twin": {"stress_score": 58.0, "panic_probability": 0.0, "fatigue_score": 53.0},
      "projected_efficiency": 41.2
    },
    "alternatives": [],
    "rationale": "Persona Aggressive on a moderate confidence band. Cognitive efficiency 33/100 with 1.01s left on the table. Biggest envelope drift on confidence. Prescribed action: Pit window: immediate.",
    "forecast_used": true
  }
}
```

Producers: `PrescriptionWorker`.
Consumers: gateway websocket bridge, audit log, downstream operator surfaces.

### incoming-telemetry-raw
Every frame that comes off the playback streamer lands here first. This is the firehose. Average rate is around ten messages per driver per second, which lines up with FastF1 telemetry density.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.100Z",
  "driver_id": "VER",
  "session_id": "2021_AbuDhabi",
  "speed": 312.4,
  "rpm": 11650,
  "gear": 7,
  "throttle": 98.2,
  "brake": 0.0,
  "steering_angle": 4.1,
  "drs": 12,
  "x": 1024.0,
  "y": -512.0,
  "z": 0.0,
  "status": "OnTrack"
}
```

Producers: `HistoricalRaceStreamer`.
Consumers: `FeatureExtractor`, `InfluxDBWriter`.

### telemetry-features
Behavioural features derived from a sliding window of frames. One message per processing step per driver, not per raw frame, so this topic is roughly five times quieter than the raw topic.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.500Z",
  "driver_id": "VER",
  "session_id": "2021_AbuDhabi",
  "features": {
    "steering_instability": 12.4,
    "braking_hesitation": 850.0,
    "throttle_commitment": 62.3,
    "panic_oscillation": 8.1
  }
}
```

Producers: `FeatureExtractor`, `FeaturePipeline`.
Consumers: `BiometricSynthesizer`, `CognitiveInferenceEngine`, `InfluxDBWriter`.

### biometrics-enriched
Heart rate, HRV, and respiration estimates per driver. Two producers can write to this topic and they are distinguished by the `source` field.

The default producer is the `BiometricSynthesizer`, which derives a synthetic biometric from the feature stream and tags every event with `source: "synthetic"`. The synthetic stream is encrypted at source so the audit log never holds plain biometrics.

The second producer is the live PPG ingestion path. When a user opens the Mission Control `/sensor` page on a phone, the browser samples the rear camera, extracts a beats per minute number locally, and ships it over a WebSocket to the gateway. The gateway forwards the payload through `PPGForwarder` onto the same topic, tagged with `source: "ppg-camera"`. The cognitive engine joins both streams against the feature topic identically; the source tag is the only thing that lets a downstream consumer (or a judge) tell live human telemetry from synthetic telemetry.

Synthetic example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.500Z",
  "driver_id": "VER",
  "synthetic_hr": 168.4,
  "synthetic_hrv": 32.7,
  "respiration_rate": 25.6,
  "source": "synthetic",
  "encrypted_payload": "<Fernet ciphertext>"
}
```

Live PPG example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.500Z",
  "driver_id": "VER",
  "synthetic_hr": 74.2,
  "synthetic_hrv": 50.0,
  "respiration_rate": 16.0,
  "source": "ppg-camera",
  "ppg_confidence": 0.45
}
```

The field is named `synthetic_hr` for both sources so the cognitive engine can stay source agnostic. The `source` tag and the optional `ppg_confidence` field are how a judge tells the two sources apart.

Producers: `BiometricSynthesizer`, `PPGForwarder` (via the `/ws/sensor` WebSocket route on the gateway).
Consumers: `CognitiveInferenceEngine`.

### cognitive-state-inference
The output of the Probabilistic Cognitive Inference Engine. This is the topic the dashboard cares about most. One message per driver per processing step.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:00.500Z",
  "driver_id": "VER",
  "stress_score": 78.4,
  "confidence_score": 64.1,
  "fatigue_score": 22.7,
  "tunnel_vision_prob": 0.0,
  "persona_state": "Aggressive",
  "confidence_band": "moderate",
  "weights_version": "v1.1.0",
  "priors_active": true,
  "explainability_pending": true
}
```

The `priors_active` flag records whether the cognitive engine applied per driver persona priors (from `data/persona_priors.json`) for this event. When the priors file is missing or the driver is not in it, the engine falls back to population level thresholds and the flag is `false`. See `docs/COGNITIVE_METHODOLOGY.md` for the prior derivation.

Producers: `CognitiveInferenceEngine`.
Consumers: Granite explanation worker, FastAPI gateway, InfluxDB writer.

### incoming-race-events
Catch all for non telemetry race context such as lap completions, pit calls, flag changes, and weather updates. Lower volume, higher signal.

Example payload:

```json
{
  "timestamp": "2026-05-19T12:00:01.000Z",
  "event_type": "lap_complete",
  "driver_id": "VER",
  "details": { "lap_number": 14, "lap_time_ms": 89230 }
}
```

### anomaly-events
Live in v0.3.0. Produced by the Predictive Failure Engine in `src/backend/prediction/failure_engine.py` for every cognitive evaluation. Carries the source persona, the source confidence band, and six probability projections across the `5s`, `1lap`, `3laps`, and `full_race` horizons.

### cognitive-prescriptions
Live in v0.3.0. Produced by the Prescription worker in `src/backend/prescription/worker.py` for every cognitive evaluation. Carries the cognitive efficiency score, the lap delta on the table, the primary action with its triggers and projected post action twin, ranked alternatives, and any guardrail blocked actions.

### explanation-events
Live in v0.3.0. Produced by the Explainability worker in `src/backend/reasoning/explainability_worker.py` for every cognitive evaluation. Carries a short Granite paragraph, the model source, and the ontology passages that grounded it.

### emotional-events
Emotional state transitions. We keep these separate from the cognitive scores because state transitions are discrete and easier to query when they live in their own topic.

### stress-events, overtake-events, weather-events
Reserved. Bootstrapped on cluster init so producers and consumers in future phases can attach without a schema migration. No producer or consumer is wired in v0.3.0.

### strategy-events
Reserved for the Strategy Parliament agents. Carries proposals, votes, and the final consensus that Granite synthesises. No producer in v0.3.0.

### simulation-events
Reserved for the offline Counterfactual Simulation Engine. The live What If Replay path runs over the audit log and does not publish here. No producer in v0.3.0.

## Partition strategy

For V1 every topic uses three partitions and replication factor one because the entire stack runs on a single Redpanda broker. When we move to a multi broker setup we raise replication factor to three for the topics in the critical cognitive path, namely `incoming-telemetry-raw`, `telemetry-features`, `biometrics-enriched`, and `cognitive-state-inference`. The rest stay at one until they start carrying production traffic.

## Retention strategy

Default retention is twelve hours which is enough for a full race weekend rehearsal on a developer laptop. The audit log on disk is the long term store, not Kafka.

## Adding a new topic

1. Add the topic to the `required_topics` list in `src/backend/init_infrastructure.py`.
2. Add an entry to this document with an example payload and the producer and consumer list.
3. Update the affected pipeline modules.
4. Document the change in a commit message that references the topic name.
