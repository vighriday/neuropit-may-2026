> **NeuroPit is a probabilistic human-state inference system for Formula racing.**
> It does not optimise the car. It infers the driver.

The pit wall has measured the car in extraordinary detail for forty years. It has measured almost nothing about the human nervous system operating the car. NeuroPit closes that gap with a real-time **Cognitive Twin** — a nine-score psychological state vector inferred from the same telemetry the team is already collecting, grounded in **IBM Granite** explainable reasoning over an **IBM Docling** motorsport cognition ontology, orchestrated through **Langflow**, and surfaced on a Mission Control pit wall that a strategist can defend in a stewards' meeting.

![NeuroPit Mission Control](docs/assets/screenshots/MissionControl2.png)
*Mission Control surface during a live replay of Abu Dhabi 2021. Cognitive rings, driver chips, and the live telemetry / heartbeat indicators sit above the secondary scores. Every value is computed by the deterministic cognitive engine in `src/backend/inference/cognitive_engine.py`.*

---

## Why this exists

A driver who has just survived a wet braking incident at three hundred kilometres per hour does not return to a neutral mental state on the next straight. Their steering becomes microscopically less stable. Their throttle commitment drops. Their heart rate variability tightens.

These changes are invisible to a conventional dashboard. They are present in the telemetry the car is already producing. NeuroPit makes them legible.

| The gap NeuroPit closes |
| --- |
| Formula teams spend **seven figures per year** on telemetry analytics. |
| Zero of them ship a defensible, real-time, audited Cognitive Twin of the driver. |
| Cognitive collapse precedes laptime collapse by 2 to 8 seconds in publicly available footage. |
| That window is where races are won. |

NeuroPit treats the driver as a probabilistic cognitive entity that can be inferred from racing telemetry. Other systems ask what is happening to the car. NeuroPit asks what is happening to the human nervous system operating the car.

The category is **Human Machine Cognitive Intelligence for Motorsport**. The unit of value is the Cognitive Twin. Everything else — the dashboard, the REST endpoints, the WebSocket — is a surface over the twin.

---

## What NeuroPit is not

- ❌ Not a telemetry analytics dashboard.
- ❌ Not a strategy copilot.
- ❌ Not a generic AI racing assistant.
- ✅ A Cognitive Twin Operating System with an audit trail.

## The Cognitive Twin, in one screen

Every evaluation tick produces:

```

Every emission ships with a confidence band (`high` / `moderate` / `unstable`), a written explanation from IBM Granite grounded in real motorsport literature, and an immutable audit log entry. The surface never displays a number without its explanation. That is a hard rule.

## IBM AI integration

| Tool | Role in NeuroPit | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **IBM Granite** | Explainable cognitive reasoning. Local Hugging Face inference using `ibm-granite/granite-3.1-8b-instruct` from the [IBM Granite open-source community](https://github.com/ibm-granite-community). No API key required. Watsonx.ai cloud is available as an optional fallback. A deterministic templated stub guarantees Mission Control never goes dark. | [`src/backend/reasoning/granite_client.py`](src/backend/reasoning/granite_client.py) |
| **IBM Docling** | Motorsport cognition knowledge compiler. Ingests FIA reports, neuroscience papers, telemetry manuals, and historical race documents into a Qdrant `motorsport_ontology` collection that grounds every Granite reasoning call. | [`src/backend/knowledge/docling_compiler.py`](src/backend/knowledge/docling_compiler.py) |
| **Langflow** | Reference orchestration flow that visualises the cognitive strategy pipeline. Importable into any Langflow instance. | [`orchestration/langflow/neuropit_strategy_flow.json`](orchestration/langflow/neuropit_strategy_flow.json) |

**Granite is called with physics-first reasoning.** Every score the model sees has already been computed deterministically from engineered features. Granite is strictly forbidden from inventing cognitive numbers. It only explains them. This is what makes the output defensible in a stewards' meeting.

## From diagnostic twin to prescriptive operating system

The Cognitive Twin tells the pit wall *what* is happening inside the driver. The Prescriptive Engine tells the pit wall *what to do about it*, and the What-If Replay engine lets the strategist *defend the call after the fact*. Three tiers, one audit trail, one Granite path.

| Tier | What it produces | Where it lives |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Diagnostic** | Nine-score Cognitive Twin per evaluation, persona label, emotional distribution, confidence band, Granite paragraph. | `src/backend/inference/`, `src/backend/reasoning/` |
| **Prescriptive** | Cognitive efficiency score (0–100), seconds of laptime left on the table this lap, typed pit-wall action with projected counterfactual twin, ranked alternatives with guardrail status. | `src/backend/prescription/` |
| **Counterfactual** | Audit-log-driven What-If replay. Pick a past window, mutate one input, re-run the deterministic cognitive maths, diff the trajectory. | `src/backend/whatif/` |

The Prescriptive Engine reads each cognitive evaluation, projects it against the **Driver Performance Envelope** (per-driver fast-lap signature in five-dimensional cognitive space, bootstrapped from interpretable persona priors and refined online from the event stream), computes the **Optimality Gap**, scores nine typed actions, vetoes the unsafe ones with hard guardrails, and emits a single primary recommendation alongside ranked alternatives. Every emission is audited. Every emission ships a Granite rationale paragraph grounded in the motorsport ontology.

The What-If Replay engine is grounded in real session data. The cognitive engine has always written every input it saw to a JSONL audit log. The replay engine reads that log back, applies typed mutations to one or more rows (e.g. drop synthetic heart rate to 110, raise throttle commitment to 90, lower steering instability), and re-runs the exact same deterministic cognitive maths over the mutated inputs. The strategist can answer "what would have happened if we had calmed the radio at Silverstone Lap 47" without leaving real data.

Both tiers go through the same JWT-protected gateway, the same WebSocket fan-out, and the same audit log as the diagnostic twin.

### The full nine-score Cognitive Twin

Stress · Confidence · Fatigue · Cognitive Load · Attention Stability · Strategic Reliability · Panic Probability · Emotional Drift · Tunnel Vision

Plus a discrete **persona label** (Panic, Aggressive, Fatigue, Defensive, Flow State, Recovery), a **nine-emotion probability distribution**, and a `high` / `moderate` / `unstable` **confidence band** travelling with every emission.

Every weight, threshold, and assumption is documented in [`docs/COGNITIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/COGNITIVE_METHODOLOGY.md). The audit log captures the active set of weights on every cognitive event, so old race replays still make sense after the constants move.

---

## Quick start

Requires **Python 3.11+**, **Node 20+**, and **Docker**.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/vighriday/NeuroPit.git
cd NeuroPit
cp .env.example .env

make install
make infra-up           # Redpanda + InfluxDB + Qdrant in Docker
make bootstrap          # Kafka topics + Qdrant collections

make backend            # terminal 1: cognitive pipeline workers
make gateway            # terminal 2: FastAPI cognitive gateway
make stream             # terminal 3: playback historical session

cd src/frontend && npm install && npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000`. Within ten seconds the cognitive trajectory starts streaming on the pit wall.

---

## Judge quickstart

If you are evaluating NeuroPit for the IBM AI Builders Challenge, this is the shortest possible path to seeing the Cognitive Twin emit live.

```bash
# 1. one-line setup (Python 3.11+, Node 20+, Docker required)
git clone https://github.com/vighriday/NeuroPit.git && cd NeuroPit && cp .env.example .env && make install && make infra-up && make bootstrap

# 2. boot the pipeline (run each in its own terminal)
make backend
make gateway
make stream

# 3. boot Mission Control
cd src/frontend && npm install && npm run dev

# 4. open http://localhost:3000
```

**What to look at, in order:**

1. **Mission Control pit-wall** at `http://localhost:3000` — driver selector, four primary cognitive rings, persona drift strip, IBM Granite reasoning panel.
2. **Reasoning panel** — confirm every paragraph is labelled `via granite-local` and cites motorsport ontology passages.
3. **Live channels** — open `ws://localhost:8000/ws/cognitive` (any WebSocket client) for the live fan-out of cognitive, emotional, anomaly, explanation, and prescription events.
4. **Audit log** — open any file under `audit_logs/cognitive-*.jsonl`. Every event carries its score inputs, the weights used, the model source, and (for explanation rows) the Granite reasoning paragraph.
5. **Methodology** — every weight is documented in [`docs/COGNITIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/COGNITIVE_METHODOLOGY.md).

If any step fails, the troubleshooting checklist lives under the FAQ at the bottom of this README.

## How NeuroPit maps to the IBM AI Builders Challenge rubric

| Rubric criterion | Where to look |
| --- | --- |
| **IBM Granite usage** | [`src/backend/reasoning/granite_client.py`](src/backend/reasoning/granite_client.py) — Granite 3.0 2B Instruct via Hugging Face by default (drop-in upgrade to Granite 3.1 8B by flipping `GRANITE_MODEL_ID`), ontology-grounded prompts, deterministic stub fallback, watsonx.ai optional path. Every reasoning event ships with its `model_source`. |
| **IBM Docling usage** | [`src/backend/knowledge/docling_compiler.py`](src/backend/knowledge/docling_compiler.py) — compiles FIA reports, neuroscience papers, and racing literature into a Qdrant collection. Retrieved at every Granite call. |
| **Langflow usage** | [`orchestration/langflow/neuropit_strategy_flow.json`](orchestration/langflow/neuropit_strategy_flow.json) — importable visual flow. |
| **Innovation** | Three-tier system: diagnostic Cognitive Twin, prescriptive engine with typed action space and Optimality Gap against a per-driver Performance Envelope, audit-log-driven What-If Replay that lets the strategist re-run real session data under a mutated input. Nobody else ships this stack. |
| **Technical depth** | Event-driven Redpanda pipeline, InfluxDB time-series persistence, Qdrant vector grounding, FastAPI WebSocket fan-out, JWT + RBAC, Fernet encryption at source, 178 unit tests, GitHub Actions CI. |
| **Explainability** | Every output ships with a Granite paragraph, a confidence band, and a JSONL audit row. Physics-first reasoning forbids Granite from inventing cognitive numbers. |
| **Impact** | Closes the seven-figure gap between telemetry analytics and driver state. Generalises to aviation, defence, surgery, esports, and elite athletics. |
| **Demo readiness** | One `make` command per terminal. Mission Control pit-wall shows the Cognitive Twin emitting within ten seconds of stream start. |
| **Open source posture** | Apache 2.0. Contributor Covenant 2.1 code of conduct. Security policy. Contributing guide. PR template enforcing methodology updates. CI on every push. |

## Demo path

The Judge Quickstart above takes you to a live Mission Control. Once the stream is running, the dashboard tells its own story in four panels.

### 1. Cognitive Twin populates

![Mission Control landing](docs/assets/screenshots/MissionControl1.png)
*The scroll narrative introduces NeuroPit before the live pit wall comes into view. The full Mission Control surface appears once you scroll past the third scene.*

### 2. Prescriptive Engine

![Prescriptive Engine panel](docs/assets/screenshots/MissionControl3.png)
*The Prescriptive Engine emits a cognitive efficiency score, the seconds on the table this lap, the prescribed pit-wall action (with the triggers that fired), the projected post-action twin, and a ranked list of alternatives. Guardrail-blocked actions sink to the bottom of the list.*

### 3. What-If Replay

![What-If drawer](docs/assets/screenshots/WhatIfReplay.png)
*The What-If drawer mutates a real audit row and re-runs the cognitive maths deterministically. Here, dropping the driver's heart rate to 110 bpm and trimming steering instability collapses stress by 72 points.*

### 4. IBM Granite explainability

![Explainability page](docs/assets/screenshots/Explainability.png)
*Every cognitive evaluation gets a short paragraph from Granite 3.0 2B Instruct, grounded in passages retrieved from the IBM Docling compiled motorsport ontology. Each paragraph carries its `via granite-local` source label.*

A minute-by-minute run order judges or recruiters can follow without you in the room lives in [`docs/DEMO.md`](docs/DEMO.md).

### Backend tier layout

![src/backend tier layout](docs/assets/screenshots/VSCoderepotree.png)
*Six runtime tiers in `src/backend/`: `inference` (Cognitive Twin), `prescription` (Prescriptive Engine), `whatif` (audit-log replay), `reasoning` (Granite + Docling + Langflow), `prediction` (Predictive Failure Engine), and `security` (JWT + RBAC + Fernet).*

---

## Security and trust

NeuroPit runs on real driver-state inference. Trust is part of the contract.

- **Encryption at source.** Biometric channels are Fernet-encrypted before they hit Kafka. The key lives in `.env`, never in code.
- **JWT + RBAC.** The cognitive gateway enforces four roles: Team Principal, Race Strategist, Driver Engineer, Neuro Analyst. Every WebSocket subscription and REST call validates the role and required scopes.
- **Audit before broadcast.** Every cognitive evaluation, prescription, and what-if replay is appended to `audit_logs/cognitive-*.jsonl` before the matching Kafka or WebSocket emit. If the audit append raises, the emit is skipped and the engine logs the drop.
- **Confidence bands, always.** No output ever leaves the engine without a `high` / `moderate` / `unstable` band attached.
- **Physics-first reasoning.** Granite is shown precomputed scores. It cannot invent cognitive numbers.

Vulnerability disclosure procedure lives in [`SECURITY.md`](SECURITY.md).

---

## Tests

```bash
make test              # 178 unit tests, no infrastructure required
make integration       # integration smoke tests, requires Redpanda running
```

CI runs the backend unit suite, the import smoke, and the frontend type check on every push and every pull request.

---

## Roadmap

- **Phase 1 (shipped, v0.3.0)** — Full nine-score Cognitive Twin, Emotional State Engine, all architectural layers, JWT gateway, Mission Control surface, OSS hygiene, GitHub Actions CI.
- **Phase 2** — Statistical adaptation. Rolling baselines, telemetry normalisation, adaptive thresholds per driver.
- **Phase 3** — Learned behavioural models. Lightweight temporal classifiers on the existing feature inputs without changing the cognitive twin output contract.
- **Phase 4** — Multimodal cognitive transformer. Reinforcement learning. Personalised driver twins. Live wearable biometrics replacing the synthetic stream.

The architecture is built so each phase swaps the inference function without rewriting the surface contract.

## FAQ

**Why infer the driver instead of optimising the car?**
Every Formula team already pays seven figures a year to optimise the car. None of them ship a defensible real-time twin of the human operating it. The category is open and the impact compounds across every high-stakes human-machine domain.

**Why a probabilistic engine instead of a deep network?**
A hackathon-trained neural network on synthetic data looks like AI on the slide deck but is impossible to defend in a code review. A weighted probabilistic engine is honest about what it knows. Every weight is documented in [`docs/COGNITIVE_METHODOLOGY.md`](docs/COGNITIVE_METHODOLOGY.md). Phase 3 of the roadmap swaps the inference function for a learned model without changing the output contract.

**Why physics-first reasoning?**
Granite is a generative model. If a strategist is going to defend a pit call against a steward, they cannot defend a number a generative model invented. Granite is shown precomputed deterministic scores and reasons over them. It explains. It does not generate the score.

**Do I need watsonx credentials?**
No. The default Granite path is local Hugging Face inference of `ibm-granite/granite-3.0-2b-instruct` (around 4 GB on disk, fits on a 16 GB workstation). To upgrade to the 8B model, set `GRANITE_MODEL_ID=ibm-granite/granite-3.1-8b-instruct` in `.env` and re-run `python scripts/download_granite.py`. Watsonx.ai is an optional cloud fallback. The deterministic templated stub is a third fallback so Mission Control never goes dark.

**Where do biometrics come from?**
The biometric synthesiser conditions heart rate, HRV, and respiration on telemetry features. They are clearly labelled `synthetic_*` everywhere they appear. Phase 4 swaps the synthesiser for a live wearable stream without changing the cognitive engine.

**What happens if Redpanda, InfluxDB, or Qdrant is offline?**
Every consumer gracefully degrades to "no grounding available" or "skipped" rather than crashing. The cognitive engine still emits the deterministic twin. The audit log still writes. Mission Control still updates over the heartbeat channel.

**Troubleshooting checklist.**
- `make infra-up` failed → check `docker compose ps`, ensure ports 9092, 8086, 6333 are free.
- Mission Control shows `awaiting cognitive stream` for more than thirty seconds → check `make stream` is running and `make backend` did not exit.
- Granite reasoning shows `via stub` → set `GRANITE_USE_LOCAL=true` in `.env` and let the model download finish on first run.
- Reasoning panel empty → Qdrant collection not bootstrapped. Run `make bootstrap` again.
