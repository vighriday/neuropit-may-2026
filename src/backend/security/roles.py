"""Role based access rules for the NeuroPit gateway.

The PRD lists five primary users. We map them to four roles because the data
engineer view and the sports neuroscientist view need the same scopes for
V1. If that assumption changes, split them here first.

Each scope is a coarse label rather than a fine grained permission. The
gateway uses these scopes to decide whether a route is allowed for a given
token. Adding a new scope is a single line change.
