"""Audit log writer.

Every cognitive decision is appended to a JSON Lines file on disk. The file
captures the inputs, the active weights, the cognitive scores, and the
confidence band, so any past decision can be inspected later without
replaying the entire stream. Race day operators need this. Investigators
need this. The dashboard does not read from it directly.
